ADModel
=======

ADModel is my attempt to create an easy to use interface for managing batches of asynchronous network connections and offer simple parsing for JSON and XML.

Asynchronous Networking
------------

NetworkOperationQueue, inspired substantially by NSOperationQueue accepts instances NetworkOperation to which you can assign an NSURLRequest or the constituents of a request, which will then generate an appropriate request. Connections are executed using NSURLConnection asynchronously, currently on the main threads run loop, although that may change.

Parsing
----------------

Any data retrieved by a NetworkOperation can either be returned as is, or passed of to an NSOperationsQueue which can be used to parse XML or JSON.

Usage
----------------

Reference the sample calls in the ADModel project to see how it can be used.

Completeness
----------------

This is still very much a work in progress, it is functional, but not polished and still missing some features I'd like it to have, like better PUT/DELETE support and HTTP Authentication.

Dependancies
----------------

This project uses these two projects (kind of one project) for parsing, if you don't need one or the other, it's not to hard to take out one or both. JSON doesn't have any dependancies, XML does link against libxml2.

TouchXML
http://github.com/schwa/TouchXML
(Project must have Other Linker Flag -lxml2 and Header Search Path /usr/include/libxml2)
